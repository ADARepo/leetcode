loop that goes until two pointers are >= their respective lengths in regex or string

take a pointer in the regex and another in the string
look at regex pointer, decide if string pointer character fits criteria and if not, return false
if (lowercase letter or '.') and '*' is at the index in string: perform a while loop of the character until end of string or character isnt the same
	- since '*' can be 0 characters of the preceding one, make sure that the loop cancels immediately if the character doesnt fit
(else ?)if lowercase letter and '*' is NOT at the index after, do a 1-1 comparison and increment both pointers


letter or period without *
letter with *
period with *
