Initial thoughts:

- the array that the letter from s goes in is dependent on counter (which dict array to be added to)
- the letter being added is always the same, only the array it gets added to changes
- counter reaches numRows - 1 after mod, so now it decrements instead of increments until hitting 0
- once hitting 0, increments again. repeat
